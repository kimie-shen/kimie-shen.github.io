During my undergraduate studies at Princeton, I completed graduate-level physics courses in quantum field theory and biological physics and standard mathematics courses in abstract algebra, complex analysis, topology, and differential geometry. For my undergraduate senior thesis, I worked with Professor [Biao Lian](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/biao-lian) to study solutions to Schr√∂dinger's equation 
on various polyhedral surfaces. Using some techniques from condensed matter physics, we demonstrate that even simple systems such as a free particle 
on the surface of a cube produces quantum chaotic behavior. I also worked with Professors [Simon Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu/) and [Denis Patterson](https://denispatterson.com/) on developing a fully spatial model of savannah forest fires in grass-forest systems. Our model demonstrates considerable deviations from standard mean-field models commonly used on forest fire modelling.
