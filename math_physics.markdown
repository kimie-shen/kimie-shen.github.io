<b>Polyhedral Wavefunctions</b>

For my undergraduate senior thesis, I worked with Professor [Biao Lian](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/biao-lian) to study solutions to Schr√∂dinger's equation 
on various polyhedral surfaces. Using some techniques from condensed matter physics, we demonstrate that even simple systems such as a free particle 
on the surface of a cube produces quantum chaotic behavior. 


<b>Savannah Forest Fires</b>

I worked with Professors [Simon Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu/) and [Denis Patterson](https://denispatterson.com/) on a fully spatial model of fires in grass-forest systems.
