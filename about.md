Born and raised in St. Paul, MN, Kimberly Shen is a rising classical pianist. First 
introduced to classical music at age ten by a CD recording of Frederic Chopin’s 
complete nocturnes, she was inspired to learn all twenty-one nocturnes in order 
to fully experience and emulate their breathtaking beauty. Since then, 
she has expanded her repertoire to include music from the baroque to contemporary 
eras. Through piano performance, she now aims to inspire others to love classical 
music and experience the joy of musical discovery.

A highly committed performer, Kimberly is a first prize winner of the Schubert Club, 
Thursday Musical, and University of Northwestern Scholarship Competitions and most 
recently was a co-winner of the Princeton University Concerto Competition. She has 
appeared at venues such as Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis, the Ordway Center in St. Paul, 
and Richardson Auditorium in Princeton. She has also performed in masterclasses for many 
esteemed pedagogues such as John Perry, Sasha Starcevich, Jan Jiracek von Arnim, Grigory 
Gruzman, and the late Nelita True, among others.

Kimberly is currently pursuing a master's degree in Piano Performance with 
[Boris Slutsky](https://peabody.jhu.edu/faculty/boris-slutsky/) at the Peabody Conservatory. Her former mentors include 
[Francine Kay](https://www.francinekay.com/), [Alexander Braginsky](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/bragi001), and Jean Krinke. 
Also an avid scientist, she graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> from Princeton University with a 
bachelor’s degree in physics and certificates in applied mathematics and music performance. 
During her undergraduate studies, she conducted prizewinning research in condensed matter 
physics, biological physics, and theoretical ecology.
